Cookies play a crucial role in web browsing, helping websites remember information about your visit. Here's a simplified explanation of how cookies work:

`Server Response:`
The server responds by sending the requested webpage along with additional information, which may include cookies.

`Cookie Storage:`
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer by your web browser. They contain information such as user preferences, login sessions, and other data relevant to your interaction with the website.

`Subsequent Requests:`
When you visit the same website again, your browser sends the stored cookies back to the server along with the new request. This allows the server to recognize you and retrieve your preferences or login information.

`Session and Persistent Cookies:`
Cookies can be categorized into session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a specified period or until you manually delete them.

`First-party and Third-party Cookies:`
First-party cookies are set by the website you're directly visiting, while third-party cookies come from other domains, such as advertisers or social media plugins embedded on the site.

`Security and Privacy:`
Cookies are generally harmless and serve useful purposes, but there are concerns related to privacy. Some cookies may track your online behavior for advertising or analytics purposes. Modern browsers provide settings to control cookie behavior and enhance privacy.
